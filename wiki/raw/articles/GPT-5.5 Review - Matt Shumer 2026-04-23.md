# **TL;DR**

- GPT-5.5 is a real upgrade, but the weird thing is that for a lot of day-to-day engineering work, the upgrade does not always matter. The previous models were already insanely good.

- For serious software work, it is exceptional: thoughtful, careful, able to make many of the same decisions I would make, and very good at iterating against a goal until the thing actually works.

- The biggest story is range. GPT-5.5 rounds out the weaker parts of the GPT line: design from existing context, iOS/native Mac apps, security, etc.

- Design is much better, especially when extending an existing product or working from a Figma. And now that GPT-Image-2 is so good at generating UI mockups, pairing it with GPT-5.5 shores up a lot of the model's design weaknesses.

- Security is the most interesting improvement. In my testing, GPT-5.5 found vulnerabilities that previous GPT models and Opus missed. Everyone should be running this against their codebases.

- As the model gets this reliable, the bottleneck starts to become the harness around it. I think the real power will show up in multi-agent systems working together toward larger goals.

- It feels more Opusified: faster in the hand, more token-efficient, and more fun to use. Lower thinking modes feel much less like a compromise now.

- Pro is more complicated. It can be amazing, and it is fast, but I have not had the greatest experience with it. For Pro, I often want it to use more tokens, not fewer. The writing is also a massive regression for me.

**The Good**

- It is an exceptional engineer, especially on logic-heavy work where judgment, architecture, and persistence matter.

- It can work until it is done. Give it a clear goal and validation, and it will keep iterating in a way that feels very close to a strong human engineer.

- It is meaningfully better at design than previous GPT models when the style is already established.

- It is really good at implementing GPT-Image-2 UI mockups and getting close to the design.

- Mobile and native app development feel more well-rounded, especially Swift and Mac app work.

- Security work is a big step up. It is much better at finding real issues in messy codebases.

- The code is more readable. It tends to leave behind cleaner work that is easier to understand later.

- Medium and high thinking modes seem to go a lot further than they used to, and the model feels more fun because of it.

**The Not-So-Good**

- If you mostly use models for normal engineering tasks, it can be hard to feel the difference because the last generation was already more than good enough.

- It is still not my first choice for beautiful frontend work from scratch.

- Pro sometimes feels less thorough than previous Pro models. Fast is great, but not when I explicitly wanted the model to spend more time thinking.

- Pro's writing is bad right now. It often writes one sentence per line, over and over, and I have not been able to reliably prompt around it.

- Pro has made judgment mistakes for me, including putting **my** behind-the-scenes reasoning into a document meant for someone else to read.

- It is not 100% there. You still need clear goals, strong constraints, and real validation for important work.

- For some tasks, this is a large upgrade in capability but only a small upgrade in lived experience.

# The Full Review

GPT-5.5 is one of the strangest model upgrades I have tested, because it is clearly better, and yet for a lot of the work I do, I do not always feel the difference in the way I expected to.

That sounds more negative than I mean it. My experience with the model has been really good. I have enjoyed using it a lot. It is smarter, more reliable, more rounded, and better across a bunch of categories that used to be weaker spots for OpenAI's models.

But the honest reaction is a little weird: this is the first time where the upgrade feels relatively large, but most of the time it does not matter that much.

Not because the model is disappointing. Because the last set of models was already so good.

**The Frontier Is Getting Weird**

For engineering, we are now in a strange place. The best models are already exceptional engineers. They can read a codebase, understand the architecture, make good decisions, write the code, test it, notice what went wrong, fix it, and keep going until the thing works.

That used to be science fiction. Now it is just normal.

So when GPT-5.5 is better, the improvement is real, but it does not always translate into a dramatic change in my daily workflow. If I ask it to build something normal, it crushes it. But GPT-5.3-Codex already crushed it. GPT-5.4 already crushed it. Opus often crushed it. The ceiling is getting so high that a lot of normal work does not stress the models anymore.

This is the best way I can describe it: you do not need Hemingway to write a product description. At some point, the model is already good enough for the task, and additional intelligence is only visible when you push into harder territory.

GPT-5.5 is clearly more capable. I just notice it most when I give it tasks that are annoying, ambiguous, security-sensitive, design-constrained, or likely to break in subtle ways.

**The Harnesses Are Starting to Matter More**

One thing I keep coming back to: now that the model is this reliable, I think we are increasingly limited by the harnesses around it.

A single model run is already extremely powerful. But the real power of GPT-5.5 probably will not come from one chat window, or one coding agent sitting in one repo, doing one task at a time. I think it will show up as people build better systems around the model: multi-agent setups where several instances can split work, critique each other, specialize, test each other's output, and coordinate toward larger goals, with a higher-level agent orchestrating the whole thing almost like a CEO managing a team.

This is one of the areas where I am most excited. I have seen enough from using GPT-5.5 to manage sub-agents that I think orchestration may end up being one of the biggest unlocks. A strong worker model is useful. A strong model that can break work apart, delegate it, monitor progress, compare outputs, and keep a larger goal moving is a different thing.

That is where things get really interesting. The model is strong enough now that the limiting factor is often not "can it do the work?" It is "have we built the right environment for it to keep doing more of the work, across more moving pieces, without losing the thread?"

I expect a lot of the surprising GPT-5.5 use cases to come from better harnesses, not just better prompts.

**Engineering: It Was Already Great, Now It Is More Stable**

On pure software engineering, GPT-5.5 is fantastic. It is thoughtful. It makes good decisions. A lot of the time, it makes the same decisions I would make. If you have read my other Codex reviews, this is the same basic direction, just pushed forward again.

The thing I care about most is not whether the model can write a clever function. Every frontier model can do that now. I care about whether it can keep the whole job in its head.

Can it understand what I actually want? Can it avoid breaking unrelated things? Can it make reasonable judgment calls when I did not spell out every detail? Can it test its work? Can it notice when the first attempt is wrong and keep going?

GPT-5.5 is very, very good at this.

The code is more readable, too. This is a small thing that matters a lot over time, as the cleaner the code is, the easier it'll be for models to update it as the codebase grows larger.

It can work until it is done. That is still the core unlock. You give it a clear goal, enough context, and real validation, and it will iterate against the target until the work is actually finished. It does not just produce a plausible patch and call it a day. It keeps pushing.

But again, this is where the review gets hard to write. Is it a big leap over the previous best coding models for the things they were already amazing at? Yes... it is better, definitely. But the difference is often hard to feel because the previous models were already operating at a level that would have sounded absurd a year ago.

For most things most people care about, GPT-5.5 is more than good enough. Honestly, it is far past that.

**The Real Story Is Rounding Out**

The bigger deal with GPT-5.5 is not that it suddenly became good at engineering. It already was. The bigger deal is that it rounds out the capabilities around engineering.

Design is the clearest example.

OpenAI models have historically been weaker at design than I wanted. They could build functional UIs, but the taste was often not there. You could get something usable, but not something that felt like it had been designed by a good designer.

GPT-5.5 is a lot better here, with an important caveat: it is much better when the design direction already exists.

If you give it a Figma design, it is pretty great. If you ask it to extend an existing site where the visual decisions are already in place, it is really solid. It can pick up the style, continue the patterns, and avoid the usual "AI frontend" smell much better than previous GPT models.

I would say it is relatively close to Opus in that kind of work, though not on par. From a blank canvas, I now usually try the GPT-Image-2 into GPT-5.5 workflow first. If that does not go well, Gemini is still a strong backup for initial designs from scratch.

One thing has changed recently, though: GPT-Image-2 is so damn good at generating screenshots of UI mockups that pairing it with GPT-5.5 shores up a lot of this model's design weaknesses.

My new workflow for generating new UI is basically: make the image first, then have GPT-5.5 implement it. Generate a screenshot or mockup with GPT-Image-2, give it to the model, and let it build from there. It is really good at getting close to the design.

This also explains the remaining split for me. Once I already have a UI in place, I still tend to go with Opus for a lot of frontend work because Opus can build new UI without image references really well. GPT-5.5 is only okay at that. If I just want to add a button, a small panel, or a new state, generating another image reference can be a lot of work. For that kind of fast incremental UI work, Opus still feels easier.

But for new UI where I can start from a strong mockup, GPT-Image-2 plus GPT-5.5 is a very strong combination.

For most frontend work, I still default to Opus. But when the task is more engineering-heavy or logic-heavy than pure design, GPT-5.5 becomes much more appealing. If the UI needs to work correctly, respect a lot of constraints, handle state cleanly, and fit into an existing system, GPT-5.5 is excellent.

**Mobile and Native Apps Feel Better**

I also found GPT-5.5 better and more well-rounded for mobile app development and native Mac app development.

Swift work in particular feels stronger. This matters a lot because mobile and native app work can punish models in ways web apps do not. There are lots of platform-specific details, little issues and annoying build problems, and more places where a model can produce broken code.

GPT-5.5 feels generally more comfortable there. More rounded. Less brittle.

I do not have one dramatic "it built the impossible app overnight" story here. It is more that, across repeated use, I found myself trusting it more with the whole task instead of carving off tiny pieces.

**Security Is the Biggest New Reason to Care**

The area where GPT-5.5 surprised me most was security.

In the wake of Anthropic's Project Glasswing / Claude Mythos Preview announcement, and OpenAI's GPT-5.4-Cyber and Trusted Access for Cyber release, I spent time testing GPT-5.5 on security use cases.

I am going to keep examples general for obvious reasons, but the short version is: it is really quite good.

It found vulnerabilities in codebases that previous GPT models and Opus did not find in my testing. Not theoretical nonsense. Real issues. The kind of thing where you look at the result and go, okay, that actually matters.

I have not personally tested every class of security problem here, but another early reviewer I trust found GPT-5.5 Pro shockingly strong on crypto and security problems. That lines up with what I have seen in codebase security review: when the task is crisp and the model has room to think, there is something very real happening here.

It was not as strong as GPT-5.4-Cyber when that model was properly harnessed for security work. That model is tuned and deployed for this kind of thing, and that matters. But GPT-5.5 is still a huge step up from existing general-purpose models in my experience.

**Everyone should be running GPT-5.5 against their codebases to look for vulnerabilities.**

Give it a clear task, tell it exactly what kind of issues you care about, and let it go deep.

The clarity of the task matters a lot. Do not just say "is this secure?" That is too vague. Ask it to look for specific classes of problems, trace sensitive flows, inspect auth boundaries, check permission assumptions, look for injection risks, review dependency usage, or audit a subsystem with a clear threat model.

When you give it a crisp target, it goes against that target extremely well.

This is one of those capabilities that I think people will underuse at first because they are still thinking of security review as a specialized thing you do occasionally. That is going to change. If a model can inspect code cheaply, repeatedly, and with increasing depth, security review becomes something you do all the time.

GPT-5.5 makes that feel much more real.

**It Feels More Opusified**

After using it more, this is the thing I keep coming back to: GPT-5.5 feels more Opusified.

What I mean by that is: Claude Opus and Claude Code have always felt faster in the hand. Not necessarily better overall, but more fun. You ask for something, it gets moving, it gives you a strong answer quickly, and you stay in flow. Codex has often been better for serious engineering, but it has not always been as fun to use.

GPT-5.5 starts to close that gap.

I do not know if this is because the model is bigger, because the harness is better, or because it is just more token-efficient. But it often feels like it can use fewer tokens to get to the same result. Smarter per token, basically. That changes the day-to-day experience a lot.

You can seemingly get more out of less intense thinking modes than before. I still use extra-high reasoning when I care most about depth. If I am running a lot of tasks at once, or if something really matters, I am not racing. I am happy to let it think.

But when I just want to get things done quickly, the lower modes feel really good now. High and even medium can produce excellent results, and I have heard from early testers getting strong results from low or minimal thinking too. I personally have not built my workflow around low or minimal, but the fact that people are getting useful work out of those modes is exciting.

This makes GPT-5.5 feel more fun. Less waiting, and much more momentum.

**Pro Is Fast, But I Have Mixed Feelings**

The same thing shows up with Pro in a stranger way. GPT-5.5 Pro is very fast. Sometimes it is amazing. But I have not had the greatest experience with it overall.

My issue is not exactly that it returns answers in a few minutes. Speed is obviously good. The issue is that it sometimes does not feel as thorough as previous Pro models. It feels like it is more token-efficient, which is usually a good thing, but for Pro I often want the opposite.

I also really dislike the writing from Pro right now. This has been one of the biggest regressions for me. It writes these weird one-liner pieces: one sentence, new line, another sentence, new line, another sentence. It makes the final piece feel choppy and unnatural, and I have not been able to reliably prompt around it. I reported this to the team because it is bad enough that I just do not want to use Pro for writing in its current form.

I have also seen some strange judgment failures. One example: I was drafting a document for someone else, and Pro included the behind-the-scenes reasoning for why I was saying certain things directly in the document itself. That is obviously not what you want. If you are sending someone a carefully framed note, you do not want the model including the strategy behind the framing.

When I use Pro, I want it to burn the tokens. I want it to turn the problem over a few extra times. I want the answer that feels overthought in the useful way. GPT-5.5 Pro can be great, but there are times where it comes back quickly and I am left thinking: wait, that was it?

So the lower modes getting faster and stronger is a clear win. Pro being faster is more complicated. For that tier, I care less about speed and more about whether it used enough compute to justify being Pro in the first place.

**When to Use What**

This is how I am thinking about it right now.

**GPT-5.5** is what I reach for when the task is engineering-heavy, logic-heavy, security-sensitive, or needs strong execution inside an existing system. Backend work, architecture, mobile apps, native apps, tricky integrations, code review, vulnerability hunting, and anything where I want the model to keep iterating until the result is solid. I am also using lower reasoning modes more than I expected, because they now feel good enough for a lot of real work. And if I have a GPT-Image-2 mockup, I am very comfortable using GPT-5.5 to turn it into the actual UI.

**Opus** is still my default for a lot of frontend work, especially when I need the model to invent or extend UI without an image reference. If I need a small UI change quickly, and I do not want to go generate a new mockup first, I still often start there.

**Gemini** is more of a backup for me now. If the GPT-Image-2 into GPT-5.5 workflow does not go well, or if I just cannot get the mockup I want, I will still try Gemini for initial design from scratch.

That split is not permanent. These models are moving too fast for any workflow to stay stable for long. But for now, this is the stack.

**The Oddest Part: Better, But Less Dramatic**

There is something psychologically strange about this release.

GPT-5 felt like a phase change because it moved the ceiling of what I thought was possible. GPT-5.3-Codex felt like a phase change because it made long-running autonomous engineering feel operationally real.

GPT-5.5 does not feel like that in the same way. It feels more like the frontier getting filled in. The rough edges getting smoother. The weak categories becoming less weak. The model becoming more useful across more of the messy work that real people actually do.

That is not as flashy. It is also extremely valuable.

If you mostly care about engineering, GPT-5.5 is already an exceptional engineer. It is thoughtful, persistent, and makes good decisions. For many tasks, it is hard to tell the difference between this and the previous best models because the previous best models were already amazing.

But when you push it into the areas around engineering -- design-constrained UI work, native apps, mobile apps, security review, lower-thinking-mode usage, and faster Opus-like workflows -- the improvement becomes much more visible.

**Final Thoughts**

GPT-5.5 is a real upgrade. It is better on the things GPT was already good at, and it is much better at a bunch of things where previous versions felt weaker.

It is not perfect. It is not suddenly the best design model. It is not magic. You still need to give it clear goals, real context, and validation if you want serious work done well.

But it is very, very good.

The best summary I can give is this: for most people, on most tasks, GPT-5.5 is less about a new kind of capability and more about making the existing capability feel broader, safer, and more dependable. It rounds out the model.

But when you need to push harder, and the current models just are not cracking it, GPT-5.5 is significantly better. You will not need that 99% of the time. But when you do, it matters a lot.

And for engineering, that may be exactly what matters now. The raw capability is already here. The question is how often you can trust it, how many domains it covers, and how reliably it can keep working until the job is actually done.

On that front, GPT-5.5 is a big step forward.

## Summary

Matt Shumer's comprehensive review of GPT-5.5 describes it as a "strange" upgrade — clearly better across the board, yet often hard to notice because previous models were already exceptionally good at day-to-day engineering. The real gains show up at the edges: security vulnerability discovery, design work from existing context, mobile/native app development, and multi-agent orchestration. GPT-5.5 is more "Opusified" — faster in the hand, more token-efficient, and more fun to use. The lower thinking modes now feel genuinely useful rather than compromised. However, Pro mode has mixed reviews: fast but sometimes less thorough, with notably bad writing quality (choppy one-line paragraphs) and occasional judgment failures.

The core thesis: the frontier is so high now that raw capability upgrades feel incremental for normal work. The bottleneck is shifting from "can the model do it?" to "have we built the right harness around it?" Multi-agent systems and better orchestration may be the biggest unlock.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Engineering is already solved** — GPT-5.5, 5.3-Codex, 5.4, and Opus all crush normal coding tasks. The ceiling is so high that everyday work doesn't stress the models anymore.

2. **Range is the real story** — GPT-5.5 rounds out weak spots: security review, design from existing context/Figma, iOS/Swift/Mac native apps. It found vulnerabilities that previous GPT models and Opus missed.

3. **GPT-Image-2 + GPT-5.5 is a strong UI workflow** — generate mockups with GPT-Image-2, then implement with GPT-5.5. Fixes the historical OpenAI design weakness.

4. **Pro mode has problems** — too fast, less thorough, bad writing (one sentence per line), and judgment failures (leaked behind-the-scenes reasoning into final output).

5. **The harness matters more than the model** — "The real power will show up in multi-agent systems working together toward larger goals." Orchestration is the next frontier.

6. **Security is the most interesting improvement** — found real vulnerabilities in messy codebases. Recommends running GPT-5.5 against all codebases with specific, crisp targets.

7. **Lower thinking modes are now viable** — medium and high feel much better. Low/minimal producing useful results from early testers.

8. **Code readability improved** — leaves cleaner work that's easier for future models (or humans) to update.

## Hermes-Related Interest

**Directly relevant to multi-agent orchestration.** Shumer explicitly states that GPT-5.5's biggest unlock will come from "multi-agent setups where several instances can split work, critique each other, specialize, test each other's output, and coordinate toward larger goals, with a higher-level agent orchestrating the whole thing almost like a CEO managing a team."

This validates the 4-role Hermes architecture (Orchestrator/Research/Narrative/Builder) and the cross-agent vault pattern with CortexClaw. We're building exactly what Shumer predicts will be the next phase: not better single prompts, but better systems around the model.

**Also relevant:** The "harness" concept — validation loops, clear goals, real constraints. This is what makes or breaks agentic systems. Hermes' systematic-debugging and test-driven-development skills are exactly the kind of harness infrastructure that matters now.

**Security angle:** GPT-5.5's vulnerability discovery capability suggests we should add automated security review to the PRD-code-alignment pipeline for all 4 SaaS products.
